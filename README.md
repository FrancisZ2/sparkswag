We aim to create opportunities and activities that positively impact students, researchers, and industry alikeâ€”by providing students with a unique experience that exposes and trains them in real-world research, and by connecting professionals with a base of users capable of producing new ideas, fulfilling research needs, and developing the skills necessary for future employment in the STEM workforce."

Purpose

The purpose of this project is to connect students with researchers in their field, providing real career experience prior to join the work force. Design a site that will allow researchers to CRUD research projects and students to view available research projects. The website should be similar to Facebook, LinkedIn, and Match.com.
